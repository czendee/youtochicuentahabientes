<h1>Start</h1>
<p>
  The first thing to do is to buy Data Engineers, Mechatronics, and Researcher Technicians
  as needed. Then you should buy an Energy Plant to be able to get more
  Researcher Technicians. Then buy some Computing Units and use the Research Tab.
  <br />
  If you run out of energy all engineers will stop! so make sure you have enough
  energy.

show the production details. Click on > to expand and see how production is calculated.

<h3>How to Start</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data Engineers, Mechatronics, and Researcher  as needed</li>
  <li>
    Buy Computing Units but focus on resource production; get at least 10
    Data Engineers and Mechatronics, see the laboratory tab.
  </li>
  <li>Research Corvette, Foundry Drone and Worker Drone</li>
  <li>
    Click the cog on top left, drag the corvette slider to max and click
    "reinforce fleet" to create your first fleet
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the crosshairs top left, activate auto fight and auto reinforce (not
